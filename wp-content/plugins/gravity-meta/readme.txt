== Description ==

A simple plugin to add custom URL parameters to Gravity forms as hidden custom fields.

Great for using custom analytics params with Gravity forms and learning where your leads come from. Works with Google Analytics params too!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gravity-meta/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add hidden dynamic fields to your Gravity forms that match URL parameters you want to track
4. Test by using a URL with parameters and then filling out a form
